# RGB-Room-Lights

This project uses an ESP8266 running a http server to control ws2812b rgb leds. The code in the arduino file is very meshed together and doesn't fit my current programming practices, but it is still something i am very proud of.

RoomLights.ino should have the ssid and password replaced and then flashed into the ESP8266
